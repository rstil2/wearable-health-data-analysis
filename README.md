# Wearable Health Data Analysis

This project analyzes health data from Apple Watch and Fitbit devices to identify user patterns and develop predictive models for activity and heart rate. It showcases key data science skills, including data cleaning, clustering, and predictive modeling.

## Overview
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensured data quality by removing missing values and unnecessary columns.
- **Clustering Analysis**: Used K-means clustering to identify user patterns based on health metrics.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Built Random Forest models to classify activity types and predict heart rate.

## Project Files
- `wearable_health_data_analysis.Rmd`: R Markdown file with the full code.
- `output/`: Contains the rendered HTML report.
- `data/`: Includes the cleaned dataset used for analysis.

## Getting Started
To replicate this analysis:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `.Rmd` file in RStudio.
3. Install necessary packages as listed in the script, then run the code.
